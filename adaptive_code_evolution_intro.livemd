# Introduction to Adaptive Code Evolution

## Overview

Adaptive Code Evolution is a powerful pattern that enables software systems to continuously evolve and improve based on usage patterns, performance metrics, and feedback loops. This pattern represents a paradigm shift from static codebases to dynamic, self-improving systems that can adapt to changing requirements and environments.

In this livebook, we'll explore the core concepts, benefits, and implementation strategies of Adaptive Code Evolution using Ash and Instructor.

```elixir
Mix.install(
  [
    {:kino, "~> 0.12.0"},
    {:ash_swarm, path: "/Users/speed/ash_swarm/"},
    {:instructor, "~> 0.1.0"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.4"},
    {:poison, "~> 5.0"},
    {:sourceror, "~> 1.0"},
    {:git_diff, "~> 0.6.4"},
    {:heroicons, git: "https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons.git", tag: "v2.1.1", sparse: "optimized", app: false, compile: false, depth: 1}
  ],
  config_path: "/Users/speed/ash_swarm/config/config.exs",
  lockfile: "/Users/speed/ash_swarm/mix.lock"
)

# Ensure local AshSwarm modules are compiled and loaded
Code.require_file("/Users/speed/ash_swarm/lib/ash_swarm/foundations/ai_code_analysis.ex")

# Set up environment variables for API access
api_key = System.get_env("GROQ_API_KEY") || System.get_env("LB_GROQ_API_KEY")

if is_nil(api_key) or api_key == "" do
  IO.puts("""
  ⚠️ **No GROQ_API_KEY found.**
  Some examples will use simulated responses.
  Set your API key in Livebook secrets as `LB_GROQ_API_KEY`.
  """)
else
  System.put_env("GROQ_API_KEY", api_key)
  IO.puts("✅ **GROQ_API_KEY loaded successfully!**")
end

# Load local AshSwarm modules explicitly

```

Adaptive Code Evolution comprises several fundamental concepts that work together to create a self-improving system:

### 1. Code Analysis

Systems that implement adaptive code evolution must be able to analyze their own structure, identify potential optimization opportunities, and determine areas that could benefit from improvement.

```elixir
defmodule Opportunity do
  defstruct description: "",
            location: "",
            rationale: "",
            severity: "",
            suggested_change: "",
            type: ""
end

defmodule CodeAnalysisResponse do
  defstruct opportunities: []
end

:ok
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.AdaptiveEvolution do
  use AshSwarm.Foundations.AdaptiveCodeEvolution

  ai_analyzer :code_quality,
    description: "Analyzes code quality using LLMs",
    analyzer_module: AshSwarm.Foundations.AICodeAnalysis,
    analyzer_function: :analyze_source_code
end

:ok
```

````

### 2. Adaptation Strategies

Once optimization opportunities are identified, the system must determine how to adapt the code to improve it. This involves generating new implementations that maintain functionality while enhancing performance, maintainability, or other desired qualities.

```elixir
# Cell 1: Define original code and usage data

original_code = """
defmodule SlowOperations do
  def fibonacci(0), do: 0
  def fibonacci(1), do: 1
  def fibonacci(n) when n > 1, do: fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
end
"""

usage_data = %{
  "call_frequencies" => %{
    "fibonacci/1" => 1000
  },
  "typical_args" => %{
    "fibonacci/1" => %{
      "n" => "typically between 10 and 30"
    }
  },
  "common_patterns" => [
    "frequent calls with incremental n values",
    "repeated calls with same n value"
  ]
}

IO.puts("Generating optimized implementation...")
```

````elixir

IO.puts("Generating optimized implementation...")

# Define a response model for optimization matching the expected JSON structure
response_model = %{
  optimized_code: "",
  explanation: "",
  documentation: "",
  expected_improvements: %{
    performance: "",
    maintainability: "",
    safety: ""
  }
}

# Prepare system message explicitly including "json"
sys_msg = """

    """

    Markdown.new(markdown)

  {:error, reason} ->
    IO.puts("❌ Optimization failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
end
````

### 3. Experiment Evaluation

Adaptive systems need to evaluate the effectiveness of code adaptations through experiments that compare the original and modified implementations across various metrics such as performance, maintainability, and safety.

```elixir
# Define helper functions for evaluation display
extract_metrics = fn result, category ->
  metrics = get_in(result, ["evaluation", category]) || []
  metrics
end

# Define original and optimized code for evaluation
original_code = """
defmodule SlowOperations do
  def fibonacci(0), do: 0
  def fibonacci(1), do: 1
  def fibonacci(n) when n > 1, do: fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

  def fibonacci(n) when is_integer(n) and n >= 0 do
    {result, _} = fibonacci_with_cache(n, %{0 => 0, 1 => 1})
    result
  end

  @spec fibonacci_with_cache(non_neg_integer(), map()) :: {non_neg_integer(), map()}
  defp fibonacci_with_cache(n, cache) do
    case Map.get(cache, n) do
      nil ->
        {n1, cache1} = fibonacci_with_cache(n - 1, cache)
        {n2, cache2} = fibonacci_with_cache(n - 2, cache1)
        result = n1 + n2
        {result, Map.put(cache2, n, result)}

### 4. Using Ash Resource for Managing Optimizations

Let's demonstrate how to use our ACE.Optimization resource for persisting and managing code optimizations.

````elixir
# Let's store an optimization in our Ash resource
result = ACE.Optimization
  |> Ash.Changeset.for_create(:optimize, %{code: original_code})
  |> ACE.Api.create()

case result do
  {:ok, optimization} ->
    # Display the stored optimization details
    Kino.Markdown.new("""
    ## Stored Optimization
    
    **ID**: #{optimization.id}
    **Module**: #{optimization.module_name}
    **Function**: #{optimization.function_name}
    **Created At**: #{optimization.created_at}
    
    ### Original Code:
    ```elixir
    #{optimization.original_code}
    ```
    
    ### Optimized Code:
    ```elixir
    #{optimization.optimized_code}
    ```
    """)
    
  {:error, error} ->
    IO.puts("Failed to store optimization: #{inspect(error)}")
    Kino.Markdown.new("Failed to store optimization in the Ash resource.")
end
````

Implementing the Adaptive Code Evolution pattern offers numerous benefits for software systems and development teams:

```elixir
implementation_considerations = [
  %{
    area: "Model Selection",
    consideration: "Choose AI models appropriate for your codebase size and complexity",
    recommendation:
      "Smaller models for frequent, simple optimizations; larger models for complex architectural changes"
  },
  %{
    area: "Evaluation Criteria",
    consideration: "Define clear metrics for evaluating optimization success",
    recommendation:
      "Balance performance improvements with maintainability and safety considerations"
  },
  %{
    area: "Integration Strategy",
    consideration: "Determine how adaptations are integrated into your codebase",
    recommendation:
      "Start with developer-approved adaptations before moving to automated integration"
  },
  %{
    area: "Feedback Mechanisms",
    consideration: "Establish ways to provide feedback on adaptation quality",
    recommendation:
      "Track which adaptations are accepted, modified, or rejected to improve future suggestions"
  },
  %{
    area: "Cost Management",
    consideration: "Monitor API usage and costs for AI services",
    recommendation: "Implement batch processing and caching to reduce redundant API calls"
  }
]

# Create a Markdown table of implementation considerations
consideration_rows =
  for consideration <- implementation_considerations do
    "| #{consideration.area} | #{consideration.consideration} | #{consideration.recommendation} |"
  end

considerations_markdown = """
### Implementation Considerations

| Area | Consideration | Recommendation |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
#{Enum.join(consideration_rows, "\n")}

### Key Benefits

1. **Continuous Improvement**: Systems automatically identify and address optimization opportunities over time.

2. **Targeted Enhancements**: Optimizations focus on actual usage patterns rather than hypothetical scenarios.

3. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Proactive identification and refactoring of inefficient code reduces accumulation of technical debt.

4. **Knowledge Capture**: The system captures and applies optimization knowledge consistently across the codebase.

5. **Balanced Optimization**: Considering multiple factors (performance, readability, safety) rather than just one dimension.

implementation_steps = [
  "1. Set up the necessary dependencies (Ash, Instructor)",

  "3. Create Ash resources for storing optimizations",
  "4. Implement code analysis functions",
  "5. Implement adaptation strategy functions",
  "6. Implement experiment evaluation functions",
  "7. Add interfaces for developer approval and feedback",
  "8. Set up monitoring for optimization effectiveness"
